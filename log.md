# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began code challenge, forked template repo, created new repo for node.js project.

**Thoughts:** I'm and nervous and excited about beginning this challenge. If I am able to stick with it, I will complete it at the same time as the coding bootcamp program I am currently enrolled in.
